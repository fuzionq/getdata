# getdata

The run_analysis.R script will take the data set from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

It will then clean and tidy the data and finally produce a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

It requires that:
* The data are extracted to your R working directory, retaining their subdirectory structure.
